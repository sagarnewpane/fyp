# Authograph

**Secure Image Sharing and Protection Platform for Creators and Privacy-Conscious Users**

Authograph is a final-year Bachelor's project built to address the growing misuse of copyrighted images and artworks on the internet. Designed for digital artists, photographers, and privacy-focused individuals, the platform enables secure sharing of images while retaining full control over ownership, usage, and privacy.

## Features

- **Image Encryption**  
  Encrypt images before uploading to ensure only authorized users can access the content.

- **Watermarking**  
  Add visible or invisible watermarks to protect against unauthorized use and assert ownership.

- **Steganography-Based Source Tracking**  
  Embed source or author information directly into the image using steganography, allowing origin tracking even if metadata is stripped.

- **DRM Controls**  
  Share images with specific users through access codes and customizable permissions (view/download limits, expiration dates, etc.).

- **AI Protection (Adversarial Perturbation)**  
  Apply imperceptible perturbations to images to prevent AI models from recognizing or misusing them.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) – Reactive, lightweight framework for building modern web interfaces.
- **Backend**: [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) – Secure and scalable Python-based web framework.
- **Database**: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) – Reliable and powerful open-source relational database.
- **AI Model Hosting**: Azure Cloud – Scalable deployment for adversarial perturbation processing.

## Why Authograph?

- Safeguard image ownership
- Prevent misuse by humans and AI systems
- Maintain trust and privacy when sharing visual content online
